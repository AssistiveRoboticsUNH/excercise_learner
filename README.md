The code is based on Christopher Munroe's code https://github.com/idkm23/exercise_learner with some modifications made in summer 2016.

Setup
====
To further develop this repository, one must have:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Android Jellybean (API 15, because the ODG uses this version at the time this was written 5/4/2016)   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Android Studio  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- ros indigo  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- rosjava http://wiki.ros.org/rosjava/Tutorials/indigo/Source%20Installation  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- ros android http://wiki.ros.org/android/Tutorials/indigo/Installation%20-%20ROS%20Development%20Environment 
  
Clone this repository in the src folder of a catkin_workspace:  
```
git clone https://github.com/ylmeng/exercise_learner  
cd ..  
catkin_make
```  

Then, open the exercise_learner folder in Android Studio and you should be ready to go. After you finish modifying the code, Android Studio can install the program on your Android device, if you connect it to your computer with a USB calble. You must enable installation from "Unknown Sources" in the Security setting.
